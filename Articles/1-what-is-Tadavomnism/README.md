# What is Tadavomnism?
  
Tadavomnism is a moral philosophy based on everything or nothing. Simply, it means: There is no consistency. A person who follows this philosophy is called Tadavomnist.  
The word "Tadavomnism" comes from a Persian sentence : "Tadavom nist." (*"تداوم نیست." in Presian*) which means "There is no consistency".  
  
Tadavomnism was firstly introduced by Behrad.B who calls himself first Tadavomnist. According to him, most of the people live this philosophy without knowing it. Behrad.B once admitted that the song "Talaagh" by Kamran Molaei was an inspiration for the name.  
  
"Tadavomnism Community" is also the name of an organization founded by Behrad.B in 2021 which is known to be a free independent community-based organization, with open-source projects (*See URL for more information:
